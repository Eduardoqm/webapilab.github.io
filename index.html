        A Vegetation Index (VI) is a spectral transformation of two or more bands designed to enhance the contribution of vegetation properties and allow reliable spatial and temporal inter-comparisons of terrestrial photosynthetic activity and canopy structural variations.[2]

        There are many Vegetation Indices (VIs), with many being functionally equivalent. Many of the indices make use of the inverse relationship between red and near-infrared reflectance associated with healthy green vegetation. Since the 1960s scientists have used satellite remote sensing to monitor fluctuation in vegetation at the Earth's surface. Measurements of vegetation attributes include leaf area index (LAI), percent green cover, chlorophyll content, green biomass and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR).

        Vegetation Indices (VIs) have been historically classified based on a range of attributes, including the number of spectral bands (2 or greater than 2); the method of calculations (ratio or orthogonal), depending on the required objective; or by their historical development (classified as first generation VIs or second generation VIs).[3] For the sake of comparison of the effectiveness of different VIs, Lyon, Yuan et al. (1998)[4] classified 7 VIs based on their computation methods (Subtraction, Division or Rational Transform). Due to advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology, high-resolution reflectance spectrums are now available, which can be used with traditional multispectral VIs. In addition, VIs have been developed to be used specifically with hyperspectral data, such as the use of Narrow Band Vegetation Indices.
        Uses
Vegetation indices have been used to:

examine climate trends;[5]
estimate water content of soils remotely;[6][7]
monitor drought;[8][9][10]
schedule crop irrigation,[11] crop management;[12]
monitor evaporation and plant transpiration.[13]
assess changes in biodiversity[14]
classify vegetation[15]
